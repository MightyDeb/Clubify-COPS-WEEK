This is my first git repository. This project is my first project on Web Development, done during the one-week hackathon DebugIT organised by COPS, IIT-BHU. Author- Debapriya Maity (IIT-BHU, ECE)

CLUBIFY

( SIMULATOR )

OVERVIEW My project is about the clubs of IIT-BHU. I am creating a website that lists all the clubs of IITBHU and states its ongoing and previous projects. It will be frontend only.

GOALS

There are so many Whatsapp group that we are confused which event is going on. Also, there are so many events going on simultaneously. It would be better if all events are summed up in a single website.
This will be a front-end project only.
